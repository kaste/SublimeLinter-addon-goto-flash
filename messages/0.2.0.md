SublimeLinter-addon-goto-flash
==============================

The plugin has gained some understanding of SublimeLinter's quiet mode.

There is a new setting `jump_out_of_quiet`, the default is true. When set, we will temporarily jump out of the quiet mode if you use the goto commands, and enter quiet mode again if you start typing again. 

Quiet mode? Quick reminder: SublimeLinter lets you put views in quiet mode. Then it will not draw underlines, squiggles etc. It will still draw gutter marks if you have'nt opted out of that, and the error panel will also show all reported errors. You can manually toggle the quiet mode using the `sublime_linter_toggle_highlights` command, e.g. bound to a key combo:

```json
  {
    "keys": ["ctrl+k", "ctrl+k"],
    "command": "sublime_linter_toggle_highlights"
  },
```

And you can control if a new view starts in quiet mode using SublimeLinter's own setting `highlights.start_hidden`. Okay, back to this plugin.

With the setting `only_if_quiet` you can basically turn this plugin off unless you're in quiet mode. T.i. you don't get the flashing effect if you want if you already see the underlines and squiggles.
